<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
GerPS-onto models the process of a German public service. It was created by extending the BBO with some domain specific concepts. In addition, some concepts are also mapped to the e-Government Core Vocabularies. The ontology was automatically populated with an exemplary German public service by parsing XML-based (XProzess, XDatenfelder) files used for describing administrative BPMN-processes and form fields involved in executing the specific service.</span>
